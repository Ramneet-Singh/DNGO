# DNGO
A pytorch implementation of Deep Networks for Global Optimization proposed in 'Scalable Bayesian Optimization Using Deep Neural Networks'[Snoek 2015]. Modified from [DNGO](https://github.com/w601sxs/DNGO) to handle a multiple output neural net. A one dimensional test case is provided. The Design of Experiment is performed by the python library pyDOE.
The result of the 1D test case is given hereafter:
